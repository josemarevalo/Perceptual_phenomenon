#  Stroop Effect Sample Analysis

This is Statistical Testing project using a sample of time measures from the Stroop task experiment. Throughout the jupyter notebook it is possible to find definition of variables, visualisations, hypothesis tests and furher analysis to explain this cognitive phenomenon.

## Definition of the Stroop Effect 

When the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") is printed in a color which is not denoted by the name (i.e., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task.

## Experiment description

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the **_color of the ink_** in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the _congruent words_ condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.
