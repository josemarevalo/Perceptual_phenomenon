Statistical Testing project of a Sample Analysis of the Stroop Effect (cognitive phenomenon)
===================
In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task.

When the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") is printed in a color which is not denoted by the name (i.e., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color.

The effect is named after John Ridley Stroop, who first published the effect in English in 1935.[1] The effect had previously been published in Germany in 1929 by other authors.[2][3][4] The original paper has been one of the most cited papers in the history of experimental psychology, leading to more than 700 replications.[4] The effect has been used to create a psychological test (Stroop test) that is widely used in clinical practice and investigation.
